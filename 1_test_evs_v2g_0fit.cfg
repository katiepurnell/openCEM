Description= ISP 2020 Central Scenario WITH SMART EVS PERFORMING V2G -> Linear uptake to 100pc all road-vehicles by 2050 (including popn growth).
  Includes Effective LRET, VRET, TRET and QRET as well as a 28%% reduction of emissions by 2030.
  All targets are assumed to reset to 0 beyond the last year they are specified in available sources.
  Includes Snowy 2.0 (It assumes a capital cost of 4 billion AUD).
  Redundant tech = 1,3,5,7,9,10,20,22,23,24,27
  Includes tech as per ISP2020: Biomass (new), CCGT, OCGT, Black & Brown Coal SC (not ccs), PV SAT, Wind (med, high & off-shore), CST 8h, Hydro (existing, no new build), PHES 6,12,24,48,168 (Snowy2.0), Batts (1,2,4)
  All tech that cannot have new builds (aka outdated tech ids 1,2,3 etc.) limited to the zones where existing generators are. Otherwise generally all regions allowed for new builds subject to build limits in const.py - with the exception of zones 4,9 and 14 which sometimes don't have capital costs in the db associated with them -> and I've mirrored that here. Tech 4 is the only one that breaks this pattern -> also not allowing 5,6 -> but doesn't matter because its no new builds.T28 (black coal new) -> following AEMOs lead and limiting to QLD & NSW (7&8).
